# Nxtwave-web-clone-internship
ðŸš€ This repository consist of the HTML and CSS of the website that i have cloned during my internship.

ðŸš€ About the Project
This is a responsive web clone created during my internship at NxtWave. Built entirely with HTML & CSS, it replicates modern website layouts with precision and clean design.

ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
Through this project, I enhanced my front-end development skills, learned the importance of pixel-perfect design, and mastered building layouts that look great on both mobile and desktop devices.

ðŸŒŸ Why It Stands Out
The project showcases my eye for detail, user-focused design, and ability to turn concepts into visually appealing, responsive web pages â€” qualities that align with real-world business needs.
