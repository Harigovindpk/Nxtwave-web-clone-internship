🚀 This repository consist of the HTML and CSS of the website that i have cloned during my internship.

🌐 Web Clone Project

🚀 *About the Project*
This is a responsive web clone created during my internship at NxtWave. Built entirely with HTML & CSS, it replicates modern website layouts with precision and clean design.

🎯 *What I Learned*
Through this project, I enhanced my front-end development skills, learned the importance of pixel-perfect design, and mastered building layouts that look great on both mobile and desktop devices.

🎯 *Key Highlights*
  Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

  Pixel-perfect design that closely matches the original website.

  Built with clean and organized code for easy readability.

🌟 *Why It Stands Out*
The project showcases my eye for detail, user-focused design, and ability to turn concepts into visually appealing, responsive web pages — qualities that align with real-world business needs.
